        <h3 style="margin-top: 7%">The Season of Cancer (June 21 – July 22)</h3>
        <p>
          Summer’s heat has arrived, but there is something softer in the air—a
          nostalgia, a longing, a pull toward home. This is Cancer season, where
          the sun moves through the sign of the moonlit guardian, calling us
          inward, asking us to feel. Cancer is ruled by the Moon, the keeper of
          tides, emotions, and memory. Under her watchful glow, intuition
          sharpens, the heart swells, and the past whispers its wisdom. This is
          a time of deep feeling, of seeking comfort, of remembering what truly
          matters.
        </p>

        <h3>Water, the Keeper of the Deep</h3>
        <p>
          Cancer belongs to the Water element, but unlike Scorpio’s intensity or
          Pisces’ dreaminess, Cancer is the tide—forever ebbing and flowing,
          shifting between what was, what is, and what could be. It moves in
          cycles, carrying emotions like the ocean carries waves, sometimes
          gentle, sometimes fierce, but always powerful beneath the surface.

        <h3>The Crab in the Stars: A Myth of Protection and Devotion</h3>
        <p>
          The Cancer constellation is linked to the story of the giant crab in
          the Twelve Labors of Hercules. Sent by Hera to attack Hercules, the
          crab was crushed beneath his foot—but in honor of its loyalty, the
          gods placed it among the stars. This tale speaks to the heart of
          Cancer: fiercely protective, devoted beyond measure, and willing to
          fight for those they love, no matter the odds. Cancer is not just the
          nurturer—it is the warrior who stands between loved ones and danger,
          shielding them with its shell, ready to strike if threatened.
        </p>

        <h3>Sun, Moon, and the Rising Tide</h3>
        <p>
          Sun in Cancer: A soul that feels deeply, loves fully, and moves
          through the world with both tenderness and strength.

          <br />

          and the past is never far from the heart.
          <br />
          Rising Cancer: A presence that is soft yet magnetic, protective yet
          inviting—people feel safe in their orbit.

        <h3>The House of Cancer: The Sanctuary Within</h3>
        <p>
          Cancer rules the 4th House, the house of home, family, and deep
          emotional roots. This is where we find our foundation, where we learn
          love, where we build our personal sanctuary. Those touched by this
          house feel the pull of memory, of ancestry, of the stories woven into
          the walls of a childhood home. Home is not just a place—it is a
          feeling, a belonging, a heartbeat that never truly fades.

        <h3>The Embodiment of Cancer</h3>
        <p>
          Cancer is the warmth of a candlelit room, the scent of old books, the
          sound of waves against the shore at midnight. It is the way hands
          linger in a soft touch, the way a song can pull tears from the soul,
          the way love is carried long after goodbye. Cancer is the unseen force
          that holds us together, the keeper of bonds that time cannot break.

        <h3>Cancer & Compatibility: Love That Feels Like Home</h3>
        <ul id="compatibility">
          <li>
            <img src="/symbols/1.png" id="symbolaries" alt="ariesicon" />
            Aries is fire, Cancer is water—one charges ahead, the other
            retreats. If they can understand each other’s rhythms, Aries brings
            excitement, and Cancer provides deep emotional grounding.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="/symbols/2.png" id="symboltaurus" alt="taurusicon" />
            A match of warmth and devotion. Taurus offers stability, Cancer
            offers care. Together, they build a love that feels unshakable.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="/symbols/3.png" id="symbolgemini" alt="geminiicon" />
            Gemini moves fast, Cancer moves deep. This can be a relationship of
            learning—if Gemini slows down and Cancer lets go of fear.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="/symbols/4.png" id="symbolcancer" alt="cancericon" /> A
            love filled with emotion, depth, and unspoken understanding. They
            must be careful not to drown in their shared sensitivity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="/symbols/5.png" id="symbolleo" alt="leoicon" /> Leo shines
            outwardly, Cancer glows inwardly. If they find balance, this can be
            a powerful union of passion and devotion.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="/symbols/6.png" id="symbolvirgo" alt="virgoicon" /> A
            gentle, thoughtful match. Virgo offers practicality, Cancer offers
            emotional wisdom. Together, they create a home full of quiet,
            unshakable love.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="/symbols/7.png" id="symbollibra" alt="libraicon" />
            Libra is social, Cancer is private. They must navigate different
            emotional needs, but if they do, they create a love that is both
            beautiful and profound.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="/symbols/8.png" id="symbolscorpio" alt="scorpioicon" />
            An intense, magnetic bond—Scorpio understands Cancer’s depth, Cancer
            softens Scorpio’s edges. A love that is transformative.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img
              src="/symbols/9.png"
              id="symbolsagittarius"
              alt="sagittariusicon"
            />
            Fire and water—a challenge, but not impossible. Cancer seeks roots,
            Sagittarius seeks wings. If they respect each other’s needs, they
            can learn from one another
          </li>
          <li>
            <img
              src="/symbols/10.png"
              id="symbolcapricorn"
              alt="capricornicon"
            />
            Opposites that fit like puzzle pieces—Cancer nurtures, Capricorn
            protects. A love built on trust, commitment, and shared goals.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="/symbols/11.png" id="symbolaquarius" alt="aquariusicon" />

            Cancer is heart, Aquarius is mind. They must work to bridge the
            emotional and intellectual divide, but if they do, they expand each
            other’s worlds.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="/symbols/12.png" id="symbolpisces" alt="piscesicon" />
            A dreamy, poetic love—two water signs flowing together in harmony.
            Deep, spiritual, and profoundly healing.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How Cancer Befriends</h3>
        <p>
          Cancer loves like the ocean—vast, endless, always present. Their
          friendships are not casual; they are chosen bonds, woven with care.
          They are the friend who senses when you need a hug, the one who keeps
          every letter, the one who shows up when the world feels too heavy.
          Once you are in their heart, you are there forever.

        <h3>How Cancer Loves</h3>
        <p>
          Cancer loves like a lullaby in the dark, like a hand reaching for
          yours beneath the table, like a home you never want to leave. They are
          deeply affectionate, incredibly loyal, and endlessly nurturing. They
          need a love that feels safe, but also one that runs deep. When Cancer
          loves you, they will remember the way you like your coffee, the
          stories you’ve told a hundred times, the way your voice changes when
          you’re sad. They do not love lightly—they love with everything they
          have.
        </p>
