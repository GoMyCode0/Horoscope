          The Season of Aries (March 21 – April 19)
        </h3>
        <p>
          As the sun blazes into Aries, the world awakens from winter’s slumber.
          The air hums with energy, and the earth stretches, eager to move, to
          act, to begin. Aries marks the start of the astrological year, the
          birth of new cycles, and the ignition of raw, untamed fire. This is
          the season of boldness, of instinct, of diving headfirst into the
          unknown. Governed by Mars, the planet of war and action, Aries charges
          forward without hesitation, eyes locked on the horizon, heart pounding
          with purpose.
        </p>

        <h3>Fire, the Untamed Force</h3>
        <p>
          Aries belongs to the Fire element, but unlike Sagittarius’ seeking
          flame or Leo’s steady burn, Aries is the first spark, the initial
          explosion, the wildfire before it is contained. It is heat in its
          purest form—impulsive, passionate, and impossible to ignore. It does
          not wait, it does not hesitate. Fire lives in every Aries, crackling
          beneath the surface, waiting for a reason to rise.
        </p>

        <h3>The Ram in the Stars: A Myth of Power and Defiance</h3>
        <p>
          The Aries constellation is tied to the myth of the Golden Ram, whose
          shimmering fleece was sought by kings and heroes. In the stars, the
          Ram stands unyielding, its horns curved in defiance, always ready to
          charge. It represents both the warrior’s instinct and the divine
          protector—the one who leads, the one who fights, the one who refuses
          to bow.

        <h3>Sun, Moon, and the Rising spark</h3>
        <p>
          Sun in Aries: The soul of a warrior, fearless, relentless, alive with
          purpose.
          <br />
          Moon in Aries: Emotion is fire—quick to ignite, quick to burn out,
          always felt with intensity. <br />
          Rising Aries: An energy that commands attention, a presence that is
          both exhilarating and impossible to ignore.

        <h3>The House of Sagittarius: The First Step Into the Unknown</h3>
        <p>
          Aries rules the 1st House, the house of self, identity, and new
          beginnings. This is the house of the trailblazer, the one who forges
          ahead without fear. It is the first breath of life, the unshakable
          belief that the world exists to be conquered. Those touched by this
          house are born leaders, instinct-driven, and unwilling to wait for
          permission to act.

        <h3>The Embodiment of Aries</h3>
        <p>
          Aries does not arrive quietly. It bursts into the room like a storm,
          eyes alight with challenge, energy vibrating through every movement.
          It is the feeling of standing on the edge of a cliff, heart pounding,
          before taking the leap. It is scraped knees and fearless grins,
          adrenaline surging through veins, the sound of a starting gun. Aries
          does not hesitate—it dares, it demands, it is.

        <h3>Aries & Compatibility: Who Can Keep Up with the Fire?</h3>
        <ul id="compatibility">
          <li>
            <img src="/symbols/1.png" id="symbolaries" alt="ariesicon" /> A
            firestorm of passion, adventure, and headstrong energy. If they
            don’t burn each other out, they can conquer the world together.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="/symbols/2.png" id="symboltaurus" alt="taurusicon" />
            Aries craves speed, Taurus values patience. Aries sees an open road,
            Taurus builds a fortress. A challenging match, but one that can
            teach balance.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="/symbols/3.png" id="symbolgemini" alt="geminiicon" /> Both
            thrive on excitement, change, and spontaneity. Fast-paced, fun, and
            full of wild ideas, but lacking grounding.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="/symbols/4.png" id="symbolcancer" alt="cancericon" />Aries
            charges forward while Cancer builds walls. Fire and water struggle
            to mix, but if Aries learns tenderness and Cancer embraces boldness,
            it can be a deep bond.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="/symbols/5.png" id="symbolleo" alt="leoicon" /> Two
            powerhouses, both craving the spotlight. Passionate, dramatic, and
            endlessly exciting—if egos don’t clash, this is a legendary love.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="/symbols/6.png" id="symbolvirgo" alt="virgoicon" /> Aries
            thrives on instinct, Virgo on logic. The Ram doesn’t plan, the
            Maiden doesn’t rush. A difficult match, but one that can sharpen
            both sides.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="/symbols/7.png" id="symbollibra" alt="libraicon" />
            Opposites in many ways, but deeply drawn to each other. Aries
            pushes, Libra balances. Fire and air can create a storm, or a dance
            of harmony.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="/symbols/8.png" id="symbolscorpio" alt="scorpioicon" />
            Passion, intensity, and a battle for control. These two don’t just
            fall in love, they collide. If they can learn to trust, the bond is
            unbreakable.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img
              src="/symbols/9.png"
              id="symbolsagittarius"
              alt="sagittariusicon"
            />
            A whirlwind of adventure, passion, and laughter. They never stop
            moving, never stop dreaming—two restless souls running together.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img
              src="/symbols/10.png"
              id="symbolcapricorn"
              alt="capricornicon"
            />
            Aries starts, Capricorn finishes. Aries is fire, Capricorn is stone.
            They can build an empire together, but not without struggle.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="/symbols/11.png" id="symbolaquarius" alt="aquariusicon" />
            Unpredictable, thrilling, full of ideas and rebellion. A partnership
            built on shared excitement, but lacking emotional depth.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="/symbols/12.png" id="symbolpisces" alt="piscesicon" />
            Fire and water—one rushes forward, the other drifts. Aries may push
            too hard, and Pisces may withdraw, but when nurtured, this can be a
            bond of deep understanding.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How Aries Befriends</h3>
        <p>
          Aries does not collect friends—they challenge them, test them, choose
          them. Their friendships are fast, intense, and full of shared
          adventures. They are the ones who dare you to take risks, who push you
          beyond your limits, who fight for you with unwavering loyalty. If
          Aries calls you a friend, they will go to battle for you.

        <h3>How Aries Loves</h3>
        <p>
          Aries loves like wildfire—fast, consuming, impossible to ignore. Their
          passion is immediate, their devotion unshakable, their affection bold.
          They do not love quietly; they love loudly, with every fiber of their
          being. But they will not be chained. Love must be exciting, electric,
          a journey of two souls burning together. If it becomes routine, Aries
          will leave, not because they do not love, but because they cannot live
          without the fire.
        </p>
