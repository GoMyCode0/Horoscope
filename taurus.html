        <h3 style="margin-top: 7%">The Season of Taurus (April 20 – May 20)</h3>
        <p>
          As the world settles into the full bloom of spring, Taurus arrives
          like a slow, deep breath. The restless energy of Taurus has set things
          in motion, and now Taurus gathers, nurtures, and builds. The days grow
          warmer, the earth grows fertile, and a sense of calm blankets the sky.
          Taurus is ruled by Venus, the planet of beauty, love, and sensuality,
          and under its influence, life becomes richer, softer, and more
          indulgent. This is a season of steady hands and patient hearts, of
          slow-burning passions and the quiet magic of consistency.
        </p>

        <h3>Earth, the Builder of Worlds</h3>
        <p>
          Taurus belongs to the Earth element, but unlike Virgo’s precision or
          Capricorn’s ambition, Taurus is the foundation, the deep, unshakable
          ground beneath our feet. It is soil rich with potential, a force that
          moves not with haste but with certainty. This is the sign of
          preservation, of creation, of loyalty that does not waver. When the
          winds shift and the fires burn, Taurus remains—steadfast, unmoved,
          eternal.
        </p>

        <h3>The Bull in the Stars: A Myth of Strength and Desire</h3>
        <p>
          The Taurus constellation is tied to the mighty Bull of Heaven, a
          symbol of both power and sacred abundance. In myth, Taurus is linked
          to Zeus, who took the form of a magnificent white bull to carry away
          the beautiful Europa. But beyond myth and legend, the Bull represents
          something greater—a force that cannot be swayed, a presence that
          endures, a creature of both grace and power.

        <h3>The House of Taurus: The Keeper of Worth</h3>
        <p>
          Taurus rules the 2nd House, the house of material wealth, security,
          and self-worth. This is the house of possessions, both physical and
          emotional, where we define what is valuable and what we refuse to let
          go. Those touched by this house are builders, creators, and protectors
          of what matters most. They understand that true wealth is not just
          gold—it is love, stability, and the legacy of what is built to last.

        <h3>The Embodiment of Taurus</h3>
        <p>
          Taurus is the warm touch of sunlight on bare skin, the scent of roses
          in full bloom, the soft weight of a well-worn book in hand. It is the
          sound of a steady heartbeat, the feeling of grass beneath bare feet,
          the comfort of a home filled with love and laughter. It is not loud,
          nor does it demand attention—but it is always there, strong and
          unwavering, offering shelter in a world that never stops moving.

        <h3>Taurus & Compatibility: A Love That Grows with Time</h3>
        <ul id="compatibility">
          <li>
            <img src="/symbols/1.png" id="symbolaries" alt="ariesicon" />
            Aries moves fast, Taurus moves slow. Aries craves excitement, Taurus
            seeks stability. If they can find a middle ground, Aries brings
            fire, and Taurus keeps it burning.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="/symbols/2.png" id="symboltaurus" alt="taurusicon" />
            A love of comfort, beauty, and deep devotion. A relationship that
            feels like home, though stubbornness may become a battle.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="/symbols/3.png" id="symbolgemini" alt="geminiicon" />
            Taurus desires depth, Gemini thrives on change. They can learn from
            each other, but Gemini may feel caged, and Taurus may feel
            exhausted.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="/symbols/4.png" id="symbolcancer" alt="cancericon" /> A
            perfect match of love, care, and shared values. This is a
            relationship built on warmth, trust, and unspoken understanding.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="/symbols/5.png" id="symbolleo" alt="leoicon" /> Both love
            beauty, pleasure, and luxury, but Leo needs adoration while Taurus
            values quiet consistency. A relationship of indulgence, but also of
            ego clashes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="/symbols/6.png" id="symbolvirgo" alt="virgoicon" /> Earth
            meets earth—a love of routine, loyalty, and shared goals. This match
            thrives on mutual respect and admiration.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="/symbols/7.png" id="symbollibra" alt="libraicon" />
            Both are ruled by Venus, meaning they share a love for romance and
            beauty. But Taurus craves commitment, while Libra flirts with the
            idea of love itself.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="/symbols/8.png" id="symbolscorpio" alt="scorpioicon" />
            Opposites that attract with deep magnetism. Taurus is earth, Scorpio
            is water—together, they can either build an unbreakable bond or
            drown in intensity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img
              src="/symbols/9.png"
              id="symbolsagittarius"
              alt="sagittariusicon"
            />
            Taurus roots, Sagittarius runs. One seeks stability, the other
            chases the unknown. A difficult match unless freedom and security
            can coexist.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img
              src="/symbols/10.png"
              id="symbolcapricorn"
              alt="capricornicon"
            />
            A powerhouse of ambition and patience. Together, they build a
            legacy, one brick at a time. A match that lasts.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="/symbols/11.png" id="symbolaquarius" alt="aquariusicon" />
            Taurus thrives on consistency, Aquarius thrives on change. A
            challenging match unless they find common ground.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="/symbols/12.png" id="symbolpisces" alt="piscesicon" />
            A beautiful, romantic pairing—Taurus provides grounding, while
            Pisces offers emotional depth and dreams. A love that feels like
            poetry.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How Taurus Befriends</h3>
        <p>
          Taurus does not rush into friendships, nor does it chase them.
          Instead, they build them like a garden—slowly, deliberately, with deep
          care. They are the friend who remembers your favorite drink, who shows
          up when you need them most, who never forgets a promise. Friendship
          with a Taurus is not fleeting—it is a lifelong bond, unshaken by time
          or distance.

        <h3>How Taurus Loves</h3>
        <p>
          Taurus loves like the turning of the seasons—steady, certain, and
          forever. They do not fall fast, but once their heart is given, it is
          given fully. Love with Taurus is warm hands, whispered reassurances,
          and the comfort of knowing that no matter what happens, they will
          always be there. They are sensual, romantic, and deeply devoted, but
          they do not tolerate games. Love must be real, or not at all.
