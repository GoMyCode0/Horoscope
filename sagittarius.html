          The Season of Sagittarius (November 22 – December 21)
        </h3>
        <p>
          As the sun strides boldly into Sagittarius, the air crackles with
          restless energy. Autumn’s golden embers surrender to winter’s first
          breath, and the cosmos hums with wanderlust. This is a time of
          boundless exploration—of ideas, of distant lands, of the infinite
          within and beyond. Sagittarius is ruled by Jupiter, the grand
          benefactor of expansion, wisdom, and fortune. Under its influence, the
          soul aches for truth, the spirit longs to roam, and the heart refuses
          to be tamed.
        </p>

        <h3>The Fire Within</h3>
        <p>
          Sagittarius belongs to the Fire element, a force of passion, movement,
          and creation. But unlike Aries' raw flame or Leo’s regal blaze, the
          Sagittarian fire is that of a torch held high, illuminating the
          unknown. It is the fire of the traveler, the philosopher, the cosmic
          student. It burns with insatiable curiosity, devouring experiences and
          leaving behind only laughter, lessons, and a trail of stardust.
        </p>

        <h3>The Archer in the Stars: A Myth Written in Constellations</h3>
        <p>
          Look to the heavens, and you will find the constellation of
          Sagittarius poised with his celestial bow, an arrow drawn toward
          Antares, the heart of the Scorpion. A warrior of knowledge, a
          protector of truth, Sagittarius is inspired by Chiron, the wise and
          wounded centaur of myth. His arrows do not seek battle, but
          enlightenment—piercing illusions, unraveling mysteries, and pointing
          toward the infinite.

        <h3>Sun, Moon, and the Rising Tides of Fate</h3>
        <p>
          Sun in Sagittarius: The soul of the adventurer, the eternal optimist,
          the lover of life’s great questions. <br />
          Moon in Sagittarius: A heart that craves space and spontaneity, a
          dreamer who refuses to be caged. <br />
          Rising Sagittarius: A presence that feels like a fresh gust of
          wind—exhilarating, unpredictable, and untamable.

        <h3>The House of Sagittarius: The Gateway to the Unknown</h3>
        <p>
          Sagittarius rules the 9th House, the realm of philosophy, long
          journeys, and the search for meaning. This is the house of scholars,
          storytellers, and spiritual wanderers. It governs foreign lands and
          foreign ideas, the moment when the mind expands beyond the familiar
          and into the extraordinary. Those touched by this house are not
          content with what is—they must chase what could be.

        <h3>The Embodiment of Sagittarius</h3>
        <p>
          Sagittarius arrives like a shooting star, leaving a trail of
          excitement and rebellion in its wake. It is laughter echoing across a
          canyon, a passport with too many stamps, a dog-eared book on ancient
          wisdom. It is the friend who texts you at midnight to say, “Pack your
          bags, we leave at dawn.” It is untamed hair, ink-stained maps, and a
          soul that refuses to settle.

        <h3>Sagittarius & Compatibility: A Love Written in the Stars</h3>
        <ul id="compatibility">
          <li>
            <img src="/symbols/1.png" id="symbolaries" alt="ariesicon" /> Fire
            meets fire, and the world burns bright with adventure. A dynamic duo
            that thrives on excitement, but beware—two flames can sometimes burn
            out just as quickly as they ignite.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="/symbols/2.png" id="symboltaurus" alt="taurusicon" />
            Sagittarius' wild heart clashes with Taurus' need for stability. One
            seeks open roads, the other craves home. Compromise is possible, but
            difficult.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="/symbols/3.png" id="symbolgemini" alt="geminiicon" /> Air
            fuels fire—this pair talks, laughs, and learns together endlessly. A
            match made in intellectual heaven, though commitment might be
            elusive.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img
              src="/symbols/4.png"
              id="symbolcancer"
              alt="cancericon"
            />Sagittarius runs where Cancer wishes to nest. The Archer’s love
            for freedom can make the Crab feel unsafe, but if nurtured
            carefully, this bond teaches deep emotional growth.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="/symbols/5.png" id="symbolleo" alt="leoicon" /> A bold,
            theatrical match. Both love grand gestures and wild adventures,
            though Leo may demand more attention than Sagittarius is willing to
            give.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="/symbols/6.png" id="symbolvirgo" alt="virgoicon" /> Order
            meets chaos. Virgo’s meticulous planning is an enigma to
            free-spirited Sagittarius. They can teach each other much, but
            patience is needed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="/symbols/7.png" id="symbollibra" alt="libraicon" /> A
            match made of beauty and excitement. Libra brings grace, Sagittarius
            brings adventure. The danger? Too much fun, not enough foundation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="/symbols/8.png" id="symbolscorpio" alt="scorpioicon" /> A
            volatile mix. Scorpio’s intensity can suffocate Sagittarius’ need
            for movement, but their connection is unforgettable when it works.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img
              src="/symbols/9.png"
              id="symbolsagittarius"
              alt="sagittariusicon"
            />
            A mirror of passion and wanderlust—these two will either run
            together or run from each other.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img
              src="/symbols/10.png"
              id="symbolcapricorn"
              alt="capricornicon"
            />
            Sagittarius laughs at rules, while Capricorn builds them. A
            challenging match, but one that can balance chaos with structure.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="/symbols/11.png" id="symbolaquarius" alt="aquariusicon" />
            Kindred spirits who dream in technicolor. Intellectual, quirky, and
            bound by a shared love for the unconventional.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="/symbols/12.png" id="symbolpisces" alt="piscesicon" /> A
            dreamer and a wanderer—both believe in magic, but Sagittarius may
            struggle with Pisces’ depth of feeling.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How Sagittarius Befriends</h3>
        <p>
          Sagittarius doesn’t collect friends—they discover them, like hidden
          treasures along the journey. They are the ones who drag you on
          spontaneous road trips, who share obscure philosophy at 3 AM, and who
          disappear for months only to return with stories too wild to believe.
          A friend of Sagittarius must be ready for adventure, laughter, and the
          occasional existential crisis.

        <h3>How Sagittarius Loves</h3>
        <p>
          Sagittarius loves without chains, without maps, without hesitation.
          They chase passion with the same fire that fuels their adventures, and
          they need a partner who understands that love is not about
          possession—it’s about shared experiences. They crave a lover who can
          run beside them, not hold them back. If you try to capture them, they
          will vanish like smoke. But if you give them freedom, they will always
          return—wild, laughing, and utterly devoted.
