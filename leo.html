        <p>
          The sun is at its peak, golden and relentless, casting long shadows
          and setting the world ablaze with heat and passion. This is Leo
          season, a time of confidence, creativity, and self-expression. Ruled
          by the Sun, the giver of life, Leo carries the fire of existence
          itself—radiant, unwavering, impossible to ignore. During this time,
          the universe dares you to take up space, to shine without hesitation,
          to roar your truth into the cosmos.
        </p>

        <h3>Fire, the Eternal Flame</h3>
        <p>
          Leo belongs to the Fire element, but unlike Aries’ spark or
          Sagittarius’ wild blaze, Leo is the steady, roaring bonfire—warm,
          powerful, illuminating. Fire is not just destruction; it is life,
          passion, transformation. Leo’s fire is a beacon, a guiding light, an
          eternal glow that refuses to be dimmed.
        </p>

        <h3>The Lion in the Stars: A Myth of Courage and Legacy</h3>
        <p>
          Leo’s constellation is tied to the Nemean Lion, a beast so powerful
          its hide was impenetrable. When Hercules was tasked with slaying it,
          he had to rely not on weapons, but on his own strength and cunning.
          After its defeat, Zeus immortalized the lion in the heavens. This
          story speaks to the unbreakable spirit of Leo—they are not invincible,
          but they believe they are, and that belief alone makes them
          unstoppable. They are born to lead, born to create, born to leave a
          mark on this world.

        <h3>The House of Leo: The Throne of the Self</h3>
        <p>
          Leo rules the 5th House, the house of creativity, romance, and
          self-expression. This is where art is born, where love is a grand
          affair, where joy becomes something sacred. Those touched by this
          house seek to create, to inspire, to leave behind something worthy of
          legend.

        <h3>The Embodiment of Leo</h3>
        <p>
          Leo is the golden hour glow, the sound of applause, the feeling of
          standing center stage. It is the warmth of a sun-drenched afternoon,
          the thrill of a lover’s undivided attention, the fire inside that
          says, “I was made for this.” It is passion turned into action, love
          turned into legend, existence turned into art.

        <h3>Leo & Compatibility: Love Fit for Royalty</h3>
        <ul id="compatibility">
          <li>
            <img src="/symbols/1.png" id="symbolaries" alt="ariesicon" />
            A fiery, passionate whirlwind—unstoppable when they lift each other
            up, but explosive if egos clash.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="/symbols/2.png" id="symboltaurus" alt="taurusicon" />
            Taurus brings stability, Leo brings excitement. If they respect each
            other’s differences, this can be an unshakable power couple.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="/symbols/3.png" id="symbolgemini" alt="geminiicon" />
            A dynamic, playful duo—both love attention, adventure, and
            socializing. A relationship full of fun, if they can keep up with
            each other.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="/symbols/4.png" id="symbolcancer" alt="cancericon" /> Leo
            shines outwardly, Cancer glows inwardly. If Leo provides warmth and
            Cancer provides depth, this can be a love of profound devotion.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="/symbols/5.png" id="symbolleo" alt="leoicon" /> A
            legendary romance or a battle of egos—two lions must decide if they
            will rule side by side or fight for the throne.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="/symbols/6.png" id="symbolvirgo" alt="virgoicon" /> Leo
            seeks grand passion, Virgo seeks quiet devotion. If Virgo admires
            Leo’s fire and Leo respects Virgo’s depth, this can be a grounding
            love.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="/symbols/7.png" id="symbollibra" alt="libraicon" />
            A match of beauty and romance—Leo loves being adored, and Libra

              alt="sagittariusicon"
            />
            A relationship full of adventure, laughter, and wild romance. These
            two inspire each other, pushing each other to dream even bigger.

            <img src="/symbols/11.png" id="symbolaquarius" alt="aquariusicon" />

            Opposites that intrigue each other—Leo is warmth, Aquarius is cool
            detachment. If they can understand their differences, they become a
            legendary duo.

          <li>
            <img src="/symbols/12.png" id="symbolpisces" alt="piscesicon" />
            A love that feels like a dream—Leo’s fire fuels Pisces’ imagination,
            and Pisces’ gentleness soothes Leo’s ego. Romantic, but sometimes
            delicate.
          </li>

        <h3>How Leo Befriends</h3>
        <p>
          Leo doesn’t just make friends, they build kingdoms. They are the
          protector, the cheerleader, the one who makes you feel like the most
          important person in the world. Their friendships are big, dramatic,
          and full of laughter, but they also expect loyalty in return. Betray
          them, and you will never be granted access to their throne again.
