          The Season of Pisces (February 19 – March 20)
        </h3>
        <p>
          As winter’s grasp softens and the first signs of spring begin to stir,
          Pisces season arrives like a dream wrapped in mist. The veil between
          worlds thins, intuition heightens, and emotions swell like the tide.
          This is the season of surrender, imagination, and deep, cosmic love.
          Ruled by Neptune, the planet of illusion, spirituality, and the
          subconscious, Pisces exists in the space between reality and reverie,
          past and future, self and universe.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a time to dream, feel, create, and let go. Pisces reminds us
          that life is poetry, not just prose.
        </p>

        <h3>Water, the Ocean’s Embrace</h3>
        <p>
          Pisces belongs to the Water element, but unlike Cancer’s nurturing
          currents or Scorpio’s dark depths, Pisces is the infinite
          sea—boundless, mystical, and ever-changing. Water is emotion,
          intuition, and connection, and Pisces feels it all.
        </p>

        <h3>The Two Fish in the Stars: A Dance Between Worlds</h3>
        <p>
          Pisces is symbolized by two fish swimming in opposite directions,
          representing the duality of existence—dream vs. reality, logic vs.
          intuition, soul vs. body. Some say one fish swims toward
          enlightenment, while the other tethers Pisces to the material world.
          This sign is a bridge between the seen and unseen, forever caught
          between drifting and returning.
        </p>
        <p>
          In mythology, Pisces is linked to Aphrodite and Eros, who transformed
          into fish to escape the monstrous Typhon. This connection speaks to
          Pisces' ability to dissolve boundaries, shapeshift, and escape reality
          when needed.
        </p>

          deep well of imagination.

          <br />

        <h3>The House of Pisces: The House of the Unseen</h3>
        <p>
          Pisces rules the 12th House, the house of the subconscious,
          spirituality, dreams, and endings. This is where the soul lets go,
          dissolves, and merges with something greater. Those influenced by this
          house are drawn to mysticism, creativity, and deep emotional
          exploration.

        <h3>The Embodiment of Pisces</h3>
        <p>
          Pisces is the glow of candlelight through fog, the feeling of déjà vu,
          the soft melody of a song that makes you cry. It is waves kissing the
          shore at midnight, the pages of a well-worn journal, the whisper of a
          forgotten dream. Pisces is love in its most unconditional form, art in
          its purest state, the quiet magic of existence.

        <h3>How Pisces Befriends</h3>
        <p>
          Pisces is the friend who listens without judgment, loves without conditions, and understands without words. Their friendships feel like safe havens—soft places to land, where emotions are honored and dreams are nurtured. They attract artists, poets, wanderers, and old souls who, like them, believe in something beyond the surface.

        <h3>How Pisces Loves</h3>
        <p>
          Pisces loves like a fairytale, like a song that lingers in the heart. They give everything—body, soul, mind, and dream. To love a Pisces is to be held in a world of soft light and endless devotion. But if hurt, Pisces disappears like mist in the morning sun. Love them gently, and they will love you forever.
