          The Season of Capricorn (December 22 – January 19)
        </h3>
        <p>
          As the old year fades and the new one rises, Capricorn season arrives
          like a solemn promise written in the bones of the Earth. The air is
          crisp, the world is quiet, and beneath the frost, life is gathering
          strength. This is the season of discipline, mastery, and long-term
          vision—a time to lay foundations, climb mountains, and turn dreams
          into legacies. Ruled by Saturn, the planet of time, karma, and
          structure, Capricorn understands that greatness is not granted, but
          earned.
        </p>

        <h3>Earth, the Pillar of Strength</h3>
        <p>
          Capricorn belongs to the Earth element, but unlike Taurus’ indulgence
          or Virgo’s precision, Capricorn is the mountain—the unshakable force,
          the steady ascent, the wisdom of stone and time. This is Earth at its
          most enduring, ambitious, and determined.
        </p>

        <h3>The Sea-Goat in the Stars: A Creature of Two Worlds</h3>
        <p>
          Capricorn’s symbol, the Sea-Goat, is a mythical being with the body of
          a goat and the tail of a fish. This duality speaks to Capricorn’s
          ability to navigate both the material and the mystical. The goat
          climbs higher than any other creature, always seeking greater heights,
          while the fish tail whispers of deep intuition and hidden wisdom.
          Capricorn is both grounded and otherworldly—pragmatic, yet touched by
          ancient magic.

        <h3>Sun, Moon, and the Rising Ascent</h3>
        <p>
          Sun in Capricorn: A soul built for greatness—patient, strategic, and
          wise beyond their years.

          <br />
          Moon in Capricorn: Emotions are deep but controlled, like an ancient
          glacier moving with purpose.

          <br />
          Rising Capricorn: A presence that commands respect and exudes quiet
          authority—people feel their gravity.

        <h3>The House of Capricorn: The House of Legacy</h3>
        <p>
          Capricorn rules the 10th House, the house of career, status, and
          life’s great work. This is where ambition meets destiny, where
          reputation is forged, and where the soul finds its highest calling.
          Those influenced by this house carry a deep sense of
          responsibility—not just for themselves, but for the world they wish to
          build.

        <h3>The Embodiment of Capricorn</h3>
        <p>
          Capricorn is the crisp air of an early winter morning, the weight of
          an old book filled with wisdom, the quiet power of a glacier shaping
          the earth. It is golden hour in an empty office, a single candle
          burning through the night, the whisper of destiny calling from the
          peak of a mountain.

        <h3>How Capricorn Befriends</h3>
        <p>
          Capricorn is not the friend who entertains, but the one who stays.
          They may take their time letting you in, but once you’re in, you have
          a protector, an advisor, and an ally for life. Their friendships are
          built on trust, loyalty, and shared ambition.

        <h3>How Capricorn Loves</h3>
        <p>
          Capricorn loves slowly but deeply. They do not fall easily or
          recklessly, but when they do, it is for the long haul. They crave a
          partner who is just as strong, just as committed, just as willing to
          build something real. Love, to Capricorn, is a promise, a
          responsibility, a foundation for the future.
