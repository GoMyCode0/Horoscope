        <p>
          As spring gives way to summer, the world hums with movement. The air
          is alive, conversations buzz, and ideas spark like fireflies in the
          dusk. This is Gemini season, a time of curiosity, transformation, and
          endless possibility. Ruled by Mercury, the planet of communication,
          intellect, and travel, Gemini is the sign of thought in motion,
          forever shifting, adapting, and seeking. The world is too vast, too
          fascinating, to stay still for long.
        </p>

        <h3>Air, the Messenger of the Skies</h3>
        <p>
          Gemini belongs to the Air element, but unlike Libra’s balance or
          Aquarius’ revolution, Gemini is the wind itself—restless, playful,
          unpredictable. It dances between worlds, gathering stories, ideas, and
          secrets, then weaving them into something new. It is the breeze that
          whispers truths, the gust that carries change, the storm that shakes
          the stagnant loose.
        </p>

        <h3>The Twins in the Stars: A Myth of Duality and Devotion</h3>
        <p>
          Gemini’s constellation is tied to the myth of Castor and Pollux, twin
          brothers bound by love but divided by fate—one mortal, one divine.
          When Castor was slain, Pollux begged the gods to let them share
          immortality, and so they were placed in the sky, forever together.
          Gemini is this eternal duality—the dance between light and shadow,
          logic and emotion, earth and sky. Those born under these stars are
          gifted with a mind that sees both sides, a heart that refuses to
          choose just one path.

        <h3>Sun, Moon, and the Rising Air</h3>
        <p>
          Sun in Gemini: A soul in constant motion, hungry for knowledge,
          conversation, and discovery.

          <br />
          Moon in Gemini: Emotions are fluid, thoughts and feelings
          intertwine—curiosity fuels connection.
          <br />
          Rising Gemini: A presence that is magnetic, charming, and
          ever-changing—people are drawn in before they even realize it.

        <h3>The House of Gemini: The Path of the Messenger</h3>
        <p>
          Gemini rules the 3rd House, the house of communication, intellect, and
          learning. This is where curiosity takes form, where ideas take flight,
          where connections are built through words, letters, and restless
          exploration. Those touched by this house never stop asking why, never
          stop searching for the next adventure, the next lesson, the next soul
          to speak to.

        <h3>The Embodiment of Gemini</h3>
        <p>
          Gemini is the spark in a stranger’s eye, the pages of an unread book,
          the thrill of a conversation that lasts until dawn. It is the feeling
          of running through a crowded city, hearing a hundred different stories
          at once, knowing you belong to all of them and none of them. It is
          laughter that flits like birdsong, thoughts that weave in a thousand
          directions, the intoxicating rush of a new idea waiting to be spoken.

        <h3>Gemini & Compatibility: Who Can Keep Up?</h3>
        <ul id="compatibility">
          <li>
            <img src="/symbols/1.png" id="symbolaries" alt="ariesicon" />
            A match full of adventure, spontaneity, and energy. Both crave
            excitement—if they can keep up with each other, they’ll never be
            bored.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="/symbols/2.png" id="symboltaurus" alt="taurusicon" />
            Taurus is grounded, Gemini is air. Taurus wants stability, Gemini
            wants change. They must find a rhythm or risk frustration.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="/symbols/3.png" id="symbolgemini" alt="geminiicon" />
            A whirlwind of conversation, laughter, and shared ideas—if they can
            stay focused on each other, this can be electric.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="/symbols/4.png" id="symbolcancer" alt="cancericon" /> Air
            meets water—Gemini flits, Cancer clings. A delicate dance, but if
            they balance each other, it’s a bond of deep emotional learning.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="/symbols/5.png" id="symbolleo" alt="leoicon" /> A dazzling
            match—Leo shines, Gemini sparkles. Both thrive in social settings,
            and their shared energy keeps things exhilarating.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="/symbols/6.png" id="symbolvirgo" alt="virgoicon" /> Both
            ruled by Mercury, but Virgo is methodical while Gemini is
            spontaneous. A mental connection is strong, but their styles may
            clash.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="/symbols/7.png" id="symbollibra" alt="libraicon" />
            Air meets air—easy, light, full of laughter and effortless
            understanding. A relationship of harmony and endless conversation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="/symbols/8.png" id="symbolscorpio" alt="scorpioicon" />
            A fascinating but difficult pairing—Scorpio is deep, intense, and
            possessive, while Gemini is elusive and ever-changing. Can be
            magnetic but chaotic.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img
              src="/symbols/9.png"
              id="symbolsagittarius"
              alt="sagittariusicon"
            />
            Opposites yet perfectly matched—both are seekers, adventurers, and
            lovers of the unknown. A relationship built on exploration.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img
              src="/symbols/10.png"
              id="symbolcapricorn"
              alt="capricornicon"
            />
            Capricorn is structured, Gemini is free-spirited. This can be a
            challenging dynamic unless they learn to respect each other’s pace.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="/symbols/11.png" id="symbolaquarius" alt="aquariusicon" />

            A cosmic connection—both love ideas, innovation, and
            unpredictability. They fuel each other’s dreams and never run out of
            things to talk about.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="/symbols/12.png" id="symbolpisces" alt="piscesicon" />
            Dreamers in different ways—Gemini is quick and curious, Pisces is
            deep and poetic. Can be beautifully creative or painfully
            misunderstood.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How Gemini Befriends</h3>
        <p>
          Gemini collects friendships like stories, each one a different shade
          of experience. They are the ones who make you laugh until you cry, who
          introduce you to people you never would have met, who send messages at
          3 AM because they just had the most interesting thought. But they are
          also elusive, always moving, always chasing the next idea. Their
          friendships are electric, unpredictable, and full of life.

        <h3>How Gemini Loves</h3>
        <p>
          Gemini loves like a poet writing verses on the wind—brilliant,
          fleeting, intoxicating. They crave mental stimulation, playful banter,
          and the freedom to explore. They do not fall for routine; they fall
          for minds that challenge them, hearts that intrigue them. If love
          feels like an adventure, Gemini will stay. If it feels like a cage,
          they will disappear before you even notice they were gone.
